After years of building with Next.js and React-based frameworks, I started to feel the weight of that complexity especially for something as personal (and should be simple) as a personal site.

Don’t get me wrong, **React is still excellent for enterprise-scale apps**. It’s solid, powerful, and battle-tested. But maintaining it for a static site or blog felt like using a spaceship to deliver a postcard.

So, I explored a bunch of alternatives and eventually fell in love with Astro. Its simplicity reminded me of the early days of handcoding in Dreamweaver, uploading via FTP, and calling it a day. No hydration drama, no heavy client bundles. Just HTML, CSS, and sprinkle-when-you-need-JS.

Adapting to Astro did take a little time. My mental model was deeply shaped by React, so thinking in components without always thinking in state and hooks took a moment to click. But once it did, it felt… right. Astro leans into how the web works, not how we’ve forced it to work.

So here we are. Back to basics, in the best way possible.
